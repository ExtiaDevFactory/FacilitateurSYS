## README: ü™Ñ File Renamer Script ü™Ñ

**Description:**

This script automates the process of renaming files based on user input, making it easier to manage and organize your files. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of files that require consistent naming conventions.

**Features:**

- ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Environment Selection:** Choose between "Homologation" or "Production" mode to ensure appropriate modifications for your environment.
-  **MULTI Replacement:** Replace occurrences of "MULTI" with a user-specified value.
-  **FSYFCISP Replacement:** Replace occurrences of "FSYFCISP" with "FSYFCISH" in Homologation mode.
-  **H07000 Increment:** Increment the last digit of "H07000" for each file, ensuring unique filenames.
-  **TO_ Preservation:** Preserve the "TO_" prefix in filenames if it exists.
-  **File Existence Check:** Avoid duplicate filenames by checking for existing files before renaming.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Install Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Script:** Clone or download the script repository to your local machine.
3. ‚å®Ô∏è **Run the Script:** Open a terminal window, navigate to the script directory, and run the following command:
   ```bash
   node run.js
   ```
4. ‚û°Ô∏è **Follow the Prompts:** The script will guide you through the process, asking for environment selection, MULTI value, and confirmation.
5. ü™Ñ **File Renaming:** The script will then rename your files according to your input and the specified rules.

**Example Usage:**

```
Choose environment (Homologation or Production): Homologation
Enter the new value for "MULTI": MultiTest
File names modified for Homologation environment.
File renamed: FSYFCISP0001.txt -> FSYFCISH0001.txt
File renamed: TO_MULTI0002.txt -> TO_MultiTest0002.txt
File renamed: H070001.txt -> H070002.txt
```
